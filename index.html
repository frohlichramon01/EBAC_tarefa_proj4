        <p>
            Pink Floyd The Wall is a 1982 British live action/adult animated surrealist musical drama film directed by
            Alan
            Parker, based on Pink Floyd's 1979 album The Wall. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and
            bassist
            Roger Waters. The Boomtown Rats vocalist Bob Geldof made his film debut as rock star Pink, who, driven to
            neurosis by the pressures of stardom and traumatic events in his life, constructs an emotional and mental
            wall
            to protect himself. However, this coping mechanism eventually backfires, and Pink demands to be set free.
